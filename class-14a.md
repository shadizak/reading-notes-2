# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together, if you like to work indevidualy so the previuse qoute not fits you.

**Our data-saturated** age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of

Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘_employee performance optimization_’’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.

**Google** — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team

The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people

Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.

‘‘At Google, we’re good at finding patterns,’’ **Dubey said.** ‘‘There weren’t strong patterns here.’’

**Imagine** you have been invited to join one of two groups.

**Team A** is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient.

**Team B** is different. It’s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another’s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn’t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.


_Which group would you rather join?_

‘‘Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,’’ **said Anita Woolley**

**The technology industry** is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture
